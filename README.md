# Lab-Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Super Silly Madlibs 
## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A madlibs game that lets users input different words to create interesting stories. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project includes creating a madlibs game which will let the user input different nouns, adjectives, and verbs to create interesting stories. The project will be done using python. It will let the users input their answers in a blank space, which will then create different stories. This project will require skills such as the input and output functions and the print function, along with strings and variables. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Something that I will accomplish no matter what is trying to build a madlibs game to the best of my effort. I will ensure that I learn all the necessary skills needed. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Something I think I can accomplish before the final deadline is not only build my game, but also ensure that it meets all the requirements. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
The best outcome of my project includes submitting it by the deadline and completing to the best of my ability. I want to build a project that not only works well, but is also entertaining for the user to play and build different stories. 
## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will be to think of a specific story and then create specific blanks so the user can then input various nouns, verbs, and adjectives to create interesting variations of the story. Some of the basic python skills that I will be using in this project include the input and output functions and the print function. Concepts such as strings and variables will also be crucial. I will need to continue to work on these python skills in order to master them to the best of my ability.
